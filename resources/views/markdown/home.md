Hey 👋🏻, I’m Quinten Buis. A Full Stack Developer living in Heerhugowaard, the Netherlands.

I’m currently working at JustBetter based in Alkmaar in the Netherlands, where I contribute to many e-commerce platforms for our clients or build backend applications that work with a variety of API’s, ensuring code quality and maintainability by implementing various tools to help us automate the boring stuff.

When I’m not writing code, I spend my spare time playing video games like Rocket League, pursuing personal projects and contributing to open source and the community.
