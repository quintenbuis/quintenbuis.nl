# Uses

## Hardware

### Macbook Air M1 (2021)
I've been using the Macbook Air since 2021 and the
speed is ridiculous!

### Sony XM3 Headset
For focussing while on the go or at a crowded office I use the Sony XM3
and it works like a charm

### Airpods Pro
When I'm moving a lot I tent to use my Airpods Pro a lot more than a headset.
It just offers that tiny bit more flexibility.

## Software

### PHPStorm
When I first got into programming in school I got a free license from school.
At the time I didn't enjoy it (maybe because of the slow (windows) laptop ðŸ˜›),
but now it has a key role in my everyday workflow! 

### TablePlus
For interacting with local or remote databases I find that TablePlus does
the job perfectly.

### Spotify
Gotta have some music to listen to ðŸ™ƒ.

### Iterm2 + ohmyzsh
Perfect terminal with great keyboard input options to quickly get around.

### Tinkerwell
Testing tiny bits of code is a breeze with Tinkerwell.

### Ray
Ray makes those pesky, hard to dd location easy to get information from.
Allround great debugging tool

### HELO
When testing emails HELO has my back. 
It's easy to configure and you get a lot of data about your email.
